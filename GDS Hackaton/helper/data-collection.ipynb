In the Museum You are greeted by the hall of Armed forces of Kazakhstan, the hall for periodic exhibitions, the hall is “Ancient” – XIX century, the hall of the military history of the XX century, the hall of weapons of the XX-XXI century, the hall of fine arts and atrium “History of military Affairs of Kazakhstan.”In each hall of the building of the Military history Museum of the Republic of Kazakhstan there is a spirit of old or present history, which the organizers were able to recreate with the help of technical means. The variety of forms in which the Museum tells visitors the history of time is striking. It seems that all the exhibits will come to life a little more, and will talk to the guests. Mirror canvases of stands dedicated to the formation of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Kazakhstan reflect those who made an impossible contribution to the development of these forces. The military history Museum is located in the former Presidential center of culture of the Republic of Kazakhstan.The military history Museum of the armed forces has collected about 6000 exhibits, including rare and especially valuable historical and cultural monuments, ammunition of Kazakh soldiers from the stone age to the present day. Weapons and Paintings, historical documents and photographs of events. Stands of military branches, events and famous personalities.The military history Museum in Astana has great differences from other museums of this nature. Its main feature is the presence of a highlight-LED TVs with a wide multimedia screen. On these screens, visitors to the Museum can see truly exciting footage from the great Patriotic war, the period of the rule of the Kazakh khans, as well as modern military events from around the world.Here you can touch the history in a literal sense, because there you can not only see a lot, but also touch and listen to it. All items that are located in the Museum building tell about the military history of the Republic of Kazakhstan, starting from ancient times and ending with the present.The military history Museum of the armed forces of the Republic of Kazakhstan at the time of its creation was like a white sheet, without a single historically important exhibit. The creators had to spend a lot of time, effort and resources to recreate the idea.
